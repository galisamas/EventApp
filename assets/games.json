             "about": "Bingo is a game of chance played with different randomly drawn numbers which players match against numbers that have been pre-printed on 5Ã—5 cards.The cards may be printed on paper or card stock, or electronically represented, and are referred to as cards. Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word 'Bingo!', which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win. All wins are checked to make sure the person has not m ade a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot.",

             "about": "This is a good way to teach the structure 'like a / an'. After teaching animal vocab and practicing moving like each animal,  line the Ss up ready for a race. The T starts each race with Ready? Run like (an elephant)! And the Ss try and win the race. Other ideas: jump like a kangaroo, crawl like a panther, swim like a fish, fly like a bird, walk like a chicken, etc. ",

             "about": "Blindfold a S and give him/her an object to feel. The S must guess what the object is. This works well with plastic animals as they are a little challenging to guess (I always throw in a dinosaur to spice things up!).",

             "about": "Have Ss sit in a circle.  T walks around the outside of the circle patting the Ss on the head saying 'dog' each time.  Suddenly, T says 'cat' as s/he touches a S's head and then that S must chase the T around the circle.  The T must try to sit in the S's spot before being tagged by the chasing S. If the T is tagged s/he must touch the heads again.  If T makes it back without being touched then the chasing S walks around the circle touching heads.  This can be done with any variation of pair words (e.g. big & small, happy & sad, can, can't, etc.).",

             "about": "This is a great vocab practice game for animal vocab. Have all Ss sit in a circle. Use a ball (or even a plastic animal) and  toss it to one S. But you must say one animal word as you pass. The S then throws to another S and says a different animal word. If the student you threw it to drops it, he/she is out. Also, if the S can't think of an animal word within a few seconds he/she is out. The game keeps going until you have one winner.",
